![SpeakEase Logo](Frontend/public/images/navbar/SpeakEaseLogo-LightMode.png)

SpeakEase is a comprehensive AI-powered platform designed to help users improve their public speaking skills through real-time video analysis, personalized feedback, and interactive training sessions.

## üéØ Project Overview

SpeakEase combines computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing to provide users with detailed analysis of their speaking performance including:

- **Eye Contact Analysis** - Track and improve gaze patterns
- **Body Language Assessment** - Analyze facial expressions and head pose
- **Speech Quality Evaluation** - Grammar, tone, and speech style analysis
- **Content Quality Assessment** - AI-powered evaluation of answer relevance
- **Real-time Feedback** - Instant coaching during practice sessions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project is structured as a full-stack application:

```
